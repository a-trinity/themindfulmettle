      subtitle: "Why?"
      text: "In many cultures, children are expected to be obedient and conformist, but the modern workplace and society require skills that go beyond compliance. Adults need to be adaptable, innovative, and able to think critically and creatively. To thrive in this environment with these expectations, children need to be encouraged to ask questions, challenge assumptions, and develop their own ideas. They need to learn how to work collaboratively, problem-solve, and communicate effectively, while also being resilient and adaptable in the face of change and uncertainty."
